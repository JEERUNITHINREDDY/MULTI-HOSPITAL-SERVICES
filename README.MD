Multi-Hospital Management Services 
Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a centralized digital platform designed to streamline and optimize the operations of multiple hospitals. The platform supports essential functionalities such as:

Patient records management
Appointment scheduling
Billing services
Facilitation of organ and blood donation
Additionally, it ensures efficient organ matching and transplantation based on availability, which could potentially save lives. The web application enhances communication, data management, and resource utilization across multiple hospital facilities using a user-friendly online interface. This also allows patients to schedule appointments conveniently and receive timely medical attention, promoting efficiency and improving overall satisfaction.

Features
Multi-Hospital Support: Manage multiple hospitals efficiently.
Patient Management: Manage patient records, appointments, and billing.
Organ Donation & Matching: Facilitate organ matching and transplantation.
Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly UI using Bootstrap.
Real-Time Location Services: Maps integration for locating nearby hospitals and donors.
Cloud-Based Media: Host images and videos via Cloudinary.
Authentication: Secure user authentication using Passport.js.
Appointment Scheduling: Patients can schedule appointments and receive real-time notifications.
System Architecture
Client-Server Model
The system follows a client-server architecture where the frontend interacts with the backend to retrieve and process data from multiple hospital systems.

Microservices Architecture
The application’s modules (e.g., patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, and donation services) are implemented as microservices, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

Technology Stack
Frontend
HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript: For building the structure and interactivity.
React.js or Angular.js: For dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive design and improved user experience.
Backend
Node.js/Express.js: Used to build the server-side logic and RESTful APIs.
JavaScript: The core programming language for backend logic.
Database
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for managing unstructured data such as medical records and logs.
API Management
RESTful APIs: For communication between frontend and backend.
API Gateway: Manages API requests, load balancing, and routing.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v12 or higher)
MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
Cloudinary Account (for media hosting)
Google Maps API (for location services)
Passport.js (for authentication)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash

Usage
Admin Dashboard
The admin can add, update, or delete hospital information, manage patient records, and handle appointments. The system also tracks organ and blood donations.

User Registration & Login
Patients and doctors can sign up and log in securely using Passport.js.

Media Uploads
Images and videos related to patients or hospital information are uploaded via Cloudinary.

Maps Integration
The application integrates Google Maps to display real-time locations of hospitals and organ donors.

Testing
Unit Testing: Tests individual components like patient records and appointment scheduling.
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work seamlessly together.
System Testing: End-to-end system testing in real-world scenarios.
Performance Testing: Assess system performance under load.
Security Testing: Identifies vulnerabilities like SQL injections or XSS.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Final validation from stakeholders.
